<p>
    Kexin Hao is a visual artist and designer born in Beijing and based in The Netherlands. 
    Her practice is a marriage of graphic design and performance art. Having initiated and being involved in various creative projects across China and 
    Europe, Kexin challenges not only geometrical borders but also disciplines of design, film, performance, and music, as well as physical 
    boundaries between art and non-art space. Using a daring visual language, the work is a constant swing between intimate close-up on personal stories and zoom-out to collective narratives; between a past of political heaviness and a flashy modernity rendered in humour and sarcasm. In her recent works, Kexin investigates in the themes of body, rituals, health, archive, and collective memory.
