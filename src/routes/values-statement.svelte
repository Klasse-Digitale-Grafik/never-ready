        Values Statement
    </h1>

    <p>Hello everyone, the Klasse Digitale Grafik and the HFBK Hamburg are proud to finally welcome you all to the Never Ready Congress, and would like to thank all of our presenters and participants for taking the time to be here for this event. We kindly ask all our presenters and participants to carry an open and curious attitude to all the unique and interesting people, ideas, and practices that you will see throughout this congress. Our intention in bringing all of you together is to create a context for dialog between perspectives from the design world that are as diverse in experience as possible into a space without hierarchy to discuss and learn about the visuality of the internet and how our design practices could look by sharing thoughts and experiences and listening to each other.</p>

    <p>A hierarchy free design space like this, where we have so many people at lots of different stages of their practices is a rare find, so everyone is heavily encouraged to step out of their comfort zones and try to meet, speak with, or have lunch with new and unexpected people from outside of their design spaces in the next three days during this congress.</p>

    <p>As for the rhetoric of this congress, derogatory remarks towards anyone or discrimination based on age, disability, gender, sexual identity, ethnic origin, and/or religion, including racism, antisemitism, islamophobia, antiziganism, sexism or unwelcome sexual attention, homophobia, queerphobia, transphobia, ableism, ageism, classism, body shaming, lookism or any other discriminative language will not be tolerated here. Everyone is encouraged to practice attentiveness to each other’s boundaries and needs.</p>

    <p>While we have this space, let’s think about how we want the design space to change in the future. The economic positioning of the designer offers some freedoms, but also has fewer safety nets for the people in this industry, and although this might not be an issue for those with financial privilege, this limits which perspectives are present in the design sphere to the privileged few. That really illustrates the importance of being self-aware and reflecting on one’s privileges as a designer. Political and economic solidarity between designers themselves and between designers and other workers makes design practice more ethical and sustainable and makes the designs being made better.</p>
    
    <p>The act of designing isn’t just an individual’s accomplishment but a practice requiring collaboration and external input. Design work today is very competitive and the structure of the industry is extremely isolating, pushing an individualistic perspective on what design practice is supposed to be and giving way to exploitation. Soulless work done just to survive is the economic reality of many designers. Open-source knowledge, tools, and resources are a great example of the power of collaboration and are the thing holding up any one individual's design practice. Open source and shared resources help not only designers but also many other parts of modern society. Contributing to and Protecting these resources from privatization should be one of the main concerns of designers today. That is also why during this congress everyone is encouraged to share as much as possible and and take advantage of this opportunity to listen to what is being shared.</p>

    <p>Currently there is a hierarchy in the types of work available to designers, but ideally all of this design work should be considered equally important. When considering what your practice could look like, it is good to consider how the different types of design work fit into your practice, such as visual, political, commercial, etc. without labeling any aspect as being more or less important than another. What are the different aspects of design practice and how are the gaps between these different aspects bridged to form a practice that is able to adapt to different circumstances, political or economic conditions and needs, and includes experimentation, collaboration, and doesn’t tie the value of a life to capital productivity.</p>

    <p>As discussions grow further in the coming days of this congress, please be mindful that this space was designated to be without any hierarchy between any people in this congress including participants, presenters, the class, and the team that put this congress together. Feel free to ask any questions and participate in dialog with everyone else here…</p>
